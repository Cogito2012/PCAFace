# PCAFace

### Data Preparation

For task 1, AT&T face data is required to be stored in `att_faces/` folder. 

For task 2, non-face data cifar10 is required to be stored in `cifar10/` folder.

### Task 1: Eigen Face and Face Reconstruction

Run the script `main_dr.m` with MATLAB, analytical results are saved in `./output` directory. 

### Task 2: Face Recognition and Verification
